# Ping Flooder
A Java program to send multiple pings a second to a URL or IP.

# How to Use
On running the program, you will be instructed to do the following:

1) Input a valid IP (but a URL will work fine too)
2) Input a valid port (by default it is set to port 80)
3) Confirm your selection

Once you do the following, you'll be instructed to input how many instances of the program you want to run.
Please note that the number you input will be threads, which will be limited to how much RAM and CPU you have. Beyond 1,000 can result in crashing your site you are pinging.

Once you input threads, the program will execute. To close it, terminate the program.
